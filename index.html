                <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
                <p>The progressive enhancement is building a website beginning with content, then adding style and interactivity. The idea is that anybody who uses any browser or device can access the core stuff without the complexity of the browser or device—the extra layers only make it prettier or better, depending on the user’s settings. It’s important because people use multiple devices, from old phones to the new browser, and you want your content to be accessible to everyone. It also helps with SEO, accessibility and higher loading time because the basic content is always there even if the nice stuff goes bad. Thinking from the content out as a Peanut M&M ensures that everyone gets something useful before we add the chocolate and candy shell.</p>
                <p>For a clear introduction to the concept, this article from MDN explains it well: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement"  target="_blank">Progressive Enhancement on MDN</a></p>

                <h2>Mars Rover Reflection</h2>
                <p>The Mars Rover Project was surely a rollercoaster. When I first had to figure out how to organize all the content within 3 pages, and in order to make sure that each rover’s mission details were correct, I was overwhelmed. I had so many small problems with images not showing up, links not working, and CSS not looking what I imagined. I just stopped trying to avoid things, especially when the animations or dark theme was not what I thought they would be.

But then things began to come together. When I started exploring how to make the scroll animations less noticeable and more noticeable, better looking, but still responsive pages came to mind – making them feel accomplished. I realized that these small details matter a lot and that patience and testing are worth the effort. By the time I finished, I had a lot of knowledge on HTML, CSS, accessibility, and I felt proud of the site I built, it was far from perfect but it is mine, and I learned so much in the process.</p>
