        <h1>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h1>
    </header>
    <p>The Mars Rover Project was surely a rollercoaster. When I first had to figure out how to organize all the content within 3 pages, and in order to make sure that each rover’s mission details were correct, I was overwhelmed. I had so many small problems with images not showing up, links not working, and CSS not looking what I imagined. I just stopped trying to avoid things, especially when the animations or dark theme was not what I thought they would be.

But then things began to come together. When I started exploring how to make the scroll animations less noticeable and more noticeable, better looking, but still responsive pages came to mind – making them feel accomplished. I realized that these small details matter a lot and that patience and testing are worth the effort. By the time I finished, I had a lot of knowledge on HTML, CSS, accessibility, and I felt proud of the site I built, it was far from perfect but it is mine, and I learned so much in the process.</p>
