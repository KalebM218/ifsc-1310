        <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    </header>
    <p>The progressive enhancement is building a website beginning with content, then adding style and interactivity. The idea is that anybody who uses any browser or device can access the core stuff without the complexity of the browser or device—the extra layers only make it prettier or better, depending on the user’s settings. It’s important because people use multiple devices, from old phones to the new browser, and you want your content to be accessible to everyone. It also helps with SEO, accessibility and higher loading time because the basic content is always there even if the nice stuff goes bad. Thinking from the content out as a Peanut M&M ensures that everyone gets something useful before we add the chocolate and candy shell.</p>
